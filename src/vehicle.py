        #do it like this?: if the light is green when the car first enters the slow down zone,

        #it will speed up when it changes.
        
        #NOTE: instead of yellow_from_red and yellow_from_green, the vehicle should should just 
        #see either red or green, which will make it either slow down or drive through. If we want yellow light, 
        #that only matters for the animation. This way we don't need to use the damping equation either
        
        
'''
Possible way to solve both traffic light and car_infront question from above, and clean up code:
Always have vehicle in vehicles on road[0]. When the light is green, set position infinity away,
when the light is red, set position at end of road and velocity zero. Then we will get traffic light behavior,
and we can remove car_infront from above and clean up some code. Still the question remains:
what is the best way to have cars switch roads? have to remember removing links between smart cars, changing
which vehicle is in front, etc. Maybe we should just start with vehicles only being able to drive straight 
through an intersection?
