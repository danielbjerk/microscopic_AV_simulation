The code for animating the simulation is a modified version of Bilal Himite's open source project hosted [here](https://github.com/BilHim/trafficSimulator). His solution for simulating traffic is documented in his Towards Data Science article posted [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-traffic-flow-in-python-ee1eab4dd20f).
